# üìä Data Card: AI Slogan Generator

This dataset supports the development of a deep learning model that automatically generates creative and relevant slogans based on a brand name or industry category. The data, sourced from Kaggle, includes slogans from real-world companies, capturing how different industries frame their messaging. The goal is to build a sequence generation model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) that can replicate these patterns.

## üìÑ Features Collected
- Brand (Company Name)
- Industry Category
- Slogan

## üéØ Purpose of Dataset
To enable development of a slogan generation system using transformer-based deep learning architectures (e.g., BART). Key goals include:
- NLP-based creative text generation
- Assisting marketers and branding teams
- Academic experimentation with sequence generation models

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Collection Process & Preprocessing Summary

### Tools Used
- Python, pandas, LSTM, Transformer (planned), Google Colab
  
### Collection Method
- Slogans were sourced from publicly available branding and marketing materials.
- The dataset was curated from multiple open sources and compiled into a structured CSV file by the original contributors on Kaggle.

### Preprocessing Steps
- Removed duplicates and missing data
- Tokenized and lowercased text
- Normalized Unicode characters

## üîí Ethical Considerations
Uses only public, non-sensitive, human-authored slogans
No personal or identifiable information included
Intended strictly for educational and research use

### Intended Use
- Educational NLP model training
- NLP research in text generation
- Exploration of transformer performance in branding tasks

### Evaluation Metrics
- Slogan diversity & coherence (human evaluation)
- BLEU/ROUGE scores for baseline benchmarking


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Tradeoffs

- Dataset skews toward Western brands and English slogans
- Output may repeat existing slogan structures due to training data bias
- No post-2023 slogan updates included in dataset

## üì¶ Version and Maintenance

- Version: 1.0
- Status: Static
- Last Updated: 04/2025
- Next Update: None scheduled

## ‚úÖ Validation

- Verified no missing values in key fields
- Removed 593 duplicates from original dataset
- Visualized slogan length distribution to inspect anomalies
